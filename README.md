# Train a Unity Environment (Banana field) using Deep Q-learning (DQN)

## Introduction

In this project, an agent is trained to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]



A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, the environment is considered solved when the trained agent achieves an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

## Getting Started

1. Create (and activate) a new environment with Python 3.6.

	- __Linux__ or __Mac__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6
	conda activate drlnd
	```
	- __Windows__: 
	```bash
	conda create --name drlnd python=3.6 
	activate drlnd
	```


2. Perform minimal installation of OpenAI Gym with PyPI
    ```
    pip install gym  
    ```

3. Clone this repository and navigate to the `python/` folder. Then, install several dependencies. 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mauricemager/udacity-project-navigation
    cd udacity-project-navigation/python
    pip install .
    ```

4. Create an [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the drlnd environment.
    ```
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name drlnd --display-name "drlnd"
    ```

5. Move one folder up, and open the `Navigation.ipynb` notebook. 
   Next, change the Python3 kernel to the new installed drlnd kernel under (_Kernel > Change Kernel > drlnd_)

    ```
    cd ..
    jupyter notebook 
    ```

6. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS or headless machines_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.


7. Place the downloaded `Banana` directory in the `data` directory and make sure the path to the `Banana.x86_64` file matching to your system in cell 2 of the Navigation notebook


8. Run all the cells of the `Navigation.ipynb` to see training and evaluation of the model
